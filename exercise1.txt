Uppgift JS - Variables and Datatypes

Exercise 1. Declare a variable with description of age and print to console.

    let age = 30;
    console.log(`This is my age: ${age}`);

Output:  This is my age: 30

Exercise 2 + 3. Declare three different keywords of three different data types.

    const area = 22.53;
    let shape = "circle";
    var isSquare = false;
    console.log(`The shape is a ${shape} with area ${area} and ${isSquare ? "is a square" : "is not a square"}.`)

Output: The shape is a circle with area 22.53 and is not a square.

    - const is a constant and can't be changed once declared.
    - let is not a constant and can be changed.
    - var is not a variation to use anymore.
    - data types: number, string and boolean. 

Exercise 4. Create a const variable and try to re-assign it. What happens and why?

    const name = "Lucas";
    console.log(name);

Output: Lucas

    try {
        name = "Lukas";
        console.log(name);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(
        "You can't re-assign the value of a const variable.",
        error.message
        );
    }

Output: You can't re-assign the value of a const variable. Assignment to constant variable
  
Exercise 7. Create two numbers, save them in the variables number1 and number2. Add these two variabels together and save the result in a new variable that you log to the console.

            let number1 = 2, 
                number2 = 4, 
                result1 = number1 + number2,
                result2 = number1 * number2, 
                result3 = number1 / number2;
  
  console.log(`Sum of number1 and number = ${number1} + ${number2} = ${result1}`)
  console.log(`Product of number1 and number = ${number1} * ${number2} = ${result2}`)
  console.log(`Quotient of number1 and number = ${number1} / ${number2} = ${result3}`)

  Output:   Sum of number1 and number = 2 + 4 = 6
            Product of number1 and number = 2 * 4 = 8
            Quotient of number1 and number = 2 / 4 = 0.5
  
Exercise 9. Create a variable a and assign it a value. Log it to the console. Now add 5 to a by reassigning the value of a by using the existing a and the number 5. Log it to the console.

    let a = 5;
    console.log(a);
Output: 5
    a += 5; // Is the same as writing a = a + 5;
    console.log(a);
Output: 10
